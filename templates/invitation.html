        Dear {{agent}},

         {{celeb}} to join our panel of celebrity judges and award presenters for Spring Sing 2023!

        Spring Sing is the oldest and greatest musical tradition, reaching back to entertainment's
         variety show roots. This annual event showcases our highest caliber of talented sudents 
         through original performances of solo songs, duets, dance routines, and comedic sketches. 
         With an audience of of over 10,000, we take great pride in selecting outstanding judges as
         examples of artistic achievement, creativity, and talent to continue to further the show's legacy.
         <br>

         Spring Sing is where stars are made and stars return to celebrate the newest generation of 
         artists. Notable past Spring Sing participants included Adam Levine, Sara Bareilles, and Nasim Pedrad;
         former judges include Dennis Quaid, Kathy Bates, and Paula Abdul.
